Hi! I am Dan, a graduate student at CU Boulder getting my master's degree in Data Science. I am interested in Machine Learning and building tools. I think there is a lot of opportunities in these technology to be utilized and figuring out ways how to do it more efficiently is important.

I intend to use this blog to write about the things I studied or did. First of all, I think it's a good exercise in order to check how good your understand really is. Secondly, these posts can be useful for someone who happens to stumble into them. And finally, it's actually pretty interesting to see your learning path!

P.S. I think I should put more info here and maybe it's even time to update something. So, yeah, I should do it sometime >:)
